(1) Article 8a(3) of the Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)3 provides that the Commission may submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and Council for establishing multiannual radio spectrum policy programmes setting out policy orientations and objectives for the strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of spectrum in accordance with the directives applicable to electronic communications networks and services. These policy orientations and objectives should refer to the availability and efficient use of spectrum necessary for the establishment and functioning of the internal market. This Decision is without prejudice to existing EU law, in particular Directives 1999/5/EC and Directives 2002/20/EC and 2002/21/EC, as well as Decision No 676/2002/EC. It is also without prejudice to measures taken at national level, in compliance with EU law, to pursue general interest objectives, in particular relating to content regulation and audio-visual policy and to the right of Member States to organise and use their spectrum for public order and public security purposes and defence.

(3) The strategic planning and harmonisation of spectrum use at Union level should enhance the single market for wireless electronic communications services and equipment as well as other Union policies requiring spectrum use, thus creating new opportunities for innovation and contributing to economic recovery and social integration across the Union, while at the same time respecting the important social, cultural and economic value of spectrum. To this end, the Union therefore needs a policy programme that covers the internal market in all Union policy areas involving the use of spectrum such as electronic communications, research and development, transport and energy.

The harmonisation of spectrum use is also essential to ensure the quality of the services provided by electronic communications and to create economies of scale lowering both the cost of deploying wireless networks and the cost of wireless devices for consumers. To this end, the Union therefore needs a policy programme that covers the internal market in all Union policy areas involving the use of spectrum such as electronic communications, research and development, transport and energy.

It is also a key action in the Digital Agenda for Europe4 which aims to deliver fast broadband internet in the future network-based knowledge economy, with an ambitious target for universal broadband coverage with speeds of at least 30 Mbps for all Europeans by 2020, thereby achieving the sustainable economic and social benefits of a digital single market. It should also support and promote other Union sectoral policies such as a sustainable environment and economic and social inclusion for all Union citizens.

It is also a key action in the Digital Agenda for Europe4 which aims to deliver fast broadband internet in the future network-based knowledge economy, with an ambitious target for universal broadband coverage. Providing the highest possible broadband speeds and capacity, ensuring not less than 30 Mbps for all by 2020 with at least half of European households having broadband access at a speed of at least 100 Mbps, is important for fostering economic growth and global competitiveness, thereby achieving the sustainable economic and social benefits of a digital single market. It should also support and promote other Union sectoral policies such as a sustainable environment and economic and social inclusion for all Union citizens. Given the importance of wireless applications for innovation, this programme is also a key initiative in support of Union policies on innovation. At the same time (Digital) Terrestrial broadcasting remains the largest and most preferred TV distribution platform, both for Commercial and Public Service Free-to-Air TV (circa 60% of European households pick their primary TV signal from terrestrial broadcasting), and in many countries, is complemented by strong pay TV offerings. For this reason the Commission and Member States should take into account the unique technological, economic and societal benefits of terrestrial broadcasting when formulating the RSPP. Terrestrial broadcasting underpins media plurality and is a force for public good. It is currently the main guarantor of universal access to television, at a minimal cost, across Europe. It is universally available to European consumers across the EU and is the consumers' choice. Demand for linear TV is growing and not decreasing. Viewing habits for many European citizens have not changed and the overwhelming majority of viewing remains via linear television. Moreover in recent years, consumers have invested significantly into digital terrestrial TV equipment.

(7) Ensuring the optimal use of spectrum as a public good may require innovative authorisation solutions such as collective use of spectrum, general authorisations or infrastructure sharing. The application of such principles in the Union might be facilitated by the definition of certain common or converging conditions for spectrum usage. General authorisations, which are the least onerous authorisation system, are of particular interest where interference does not risk hampering the development of other services.

(8) Spectrum rights trading combined with flexible usage conditions should substantially benefit economic growth. Therefore, bands where flexible use has already been introduced by Union law should be immediately made tradable pursuant to the Framework Directive. In addition, common principles for the format and content of such tradable rights as well as common measures to prevent accumulation of spectrum which may create dominant positions as well as undue failure to use acquired spectrum, would facilitate the coordinated introduction by all Member States of these measures and facilitate acquisition of such rights anywhere in the Union.

(9) As underlined in the Digital Agenda for Europe, wireless broadband is an important means to boost competition, consumer choice and access in rural and other areas where deployment of wired broadband is difficult or economically unviable. However, spectrum management may affect competition by changing the role and power of market players, for example if existing users receive undue competitive advantages. Limited spectrum access, in particular when appropriate spectrum becomes scarcer, can create a barrier to entry for new services or applications and hamper innovation and competition. Acquisition of new usage rights, including through spectrum trading or other transactions between users, and the introduction of new flexible criteria for spectrum use can have an impact on the existing competitive situation. Member States should therefore take appropriate ex ante or ex post regulatory measures (such as action to amend existing rights, to prohibit certain acquisitions of spectrum rights, to impose conditions on spectrum hoarding and efficient use such as those referred to in Article 9 paragraph 7 of the Framework Directive, to limit the amount of spectrum for each operator, or to avoid excessive accumulation of spectrum) to avoid distortions of competition in line with the principles underpinning Article 5(6) of Directive 2002/20/EC (the ‘Authorisation’ Directive) and Article 1(2) of Directive 87/372/EEC (the ‘GSM’ Directive).

While Commission Decision 2007/344/EC on harmonised availability of information regarding spectrum use within the Community6 requires Member States to publish information on usage rights, a detailed inventory of existing spectrum use together with an effective review and assessment methodology are necessary in the Union to improve the efficiency of spectrum and radio equipment use, in particular between 300 MHz and 3 GHz. This would help to identify inefficient technologies and usages in both the commercial and public sectors, as well as unused assignments and sharing opportunities, and to evaluate future consumer and business needs.

(11) Harmonised standards under Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity7 are essential to achieve efficient spectrum use and should take account of legally defined sharing conditions. European standards for non-radio electric and electronic equipment and networks should also avoid disturbance to spectrum use. The cumulative impact of the increasing volume and density of wireless devices and applications combined with the diversity of spectrum use challenges current approaches to interference management.

(11) Harmonised standards under Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity7 are essential to achieve efficient spectrum use and should take account of legally defined sharing conditions. European standards for non-radio electric and electronic equipment and networks should also avoid disturbance to spectrum use. The cumulative impact of the increasing volume and density of wireless devices and applications combined with the diversity of spectrum use challenges current approaches to interference management. These should be examined and reassessed together with receiver characteristics and more sophisticated interference avoidance mechanisms, with the aim of avoiding harmful interference or disturbance to existing and future spectrum use. Moreover, the direct cost of resolving interference issues and migration costs to enable the Digital Dividend should not be borne by the broadcasting industry nor by the EU citizens or should be adequately compensated.

(11a) New Long-Term Evolution (LTE) broadband mobile communications networks are being rolled out in various Member States. Those networks use the 790-862 MHz frequency band. Some radio microphones currently operate in that band, possibly causing interference. This may also concern devices operated in schools, theatres and conference venues or by other commercial, public or private users. The requisite technical retrofitting will be achievable only with considerable financial outlay, and it is imperative to clarify where responsibility lies in this connection.

(12a) According to multiple converging studies, mobile data traffic is increasing rapidly and is currently being doubled every year. With this pace, which is likely to continue in the next coming years, mobile data traffic will have increased nearly 40 times from 2009 to 2014. In order to manage this exponential growth, a number of actions will be required by regulators and market players including increased spectrum efficiency across the board, possible further harmonised spectrum allocations for wireless broadband, and traffic offload onto other networks via multi-mode devices.

(13) The 800 MHz band is optimal for the coverage of large areas by wireless broadband services. Building on the harmonisation of technical conditions under Decision 2010/267/EU, and on Commission Recommendation of 28 October 2009 calling for analogue broadcasting to be switched off by 1 January 2012, and given rapid national regulatory developments, this band should in principle be made available for electronic communications in the Union by 2013. In the longer term, additional spectrum below 790 MHz could also be envisaged, depending on experience and the lack of spectrum in other bands adequate for coverage. Considering the capacity of the 800 MHz band to transmit over large areas, coverage obligations should be attached to rights.

Considering the capacity of the 800 MHz band to transmit over large areas, coverage obligations achieved through the principles of technical and service neutrality should be attached to rights. Further spectrum harmonisation in the 1.5 GHz band (1452-1492 MHz), a band already shared between satellite and terrestrial use, and the freeing up of the 2.3 GHz band (2300-2400 MHz) in support of the increasing demand for mobile broadband services should ensure a level playing field between different technological solutions and support the emergence of pan-European operators within the Union. Further mobile service spectrum allocations, such as the 700 MHz band (694-790 MHz), should be evaluated depending on future capacity requirements for wireless broadband services and terrestrial TV.

In the longer term, the use of the entire radio spectrum range could be reviewed, depending on actual market demands plus social and cultural objectives. Furthermore, consumers and the broadcasting industry are now making substantial efforts and investments in clearing the 800 MHz band. Consequently, no additional change of use should be considered for the remaining broadcast spectrum.

(13a) Commission Decision 2010/267/EU designated the 800 MHz band for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communication services leaving the Member States to decide individually whether and at what point in time to designate or make available the 800 MHz band for such systems. Nevertheless, with a view to achieving the targets for broadband coverage set up by the Europe 2020 Strategy, the introduction of a deadline for making available the 800 MHz band for systems capable of providing electronic communication services may be needed.

(13b) It has to be acknowledged that fixing of any obligatory deadline for making available the 800 Mhz band for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communication services could have direct implications on the organisation of the use of the band for general interest objectives or public security and defence purposes in some Member States. Furthermore, the optimal use of 800 MHz band may be impeded in cases where third countries have decided on different uses that cause harmful interference in some Member States and prevent them from efficient use of the 800 MHz band for systems capable of providing electronic communication services on their whole territory or on a part of it. In such cases the deadline to be set up in the present Decision for implementation of Commission Decision 2010/267/EU may need to be postponed in some Member States.

Conditions could include coverage obligations, spectrum block size, the timing of granting rights, access to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and the duration of rights of use. Reflecting the importance of spectrum trading for increasing efficient use of spectrum and developing the internal market for wireless equipment and services, these conditions should apply to spectrum bands that are allocated to wireless communications, and for which rights of use may be transferred or leased.

Optimising synergies between spectrum policy and R&D activities and carrying out studies of radio compatibility between different spectrum users should help innovation. The Commission's Joint Research Centre should help in developing the technical aspects of spectrum regulation, notably by providing testing facilities to verify interference models relevant to Union legislation. Moreover, results of research under the Seventh Framework Programme require the examination of the spectrum needs of projects that may have a large economic or investment potential, in particular for SMEs, e.g. cognitive radio or e-health.

(17) Protection of public health against electromagnetic fields is essential for citizens‘ well-being and for a coherent approach to spectrum authorisation in the Union; while subject to Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, it is essential to ensure constant monitoring of the ionising and non-ionising effects of spectrum use on health, including the real-life cumulative effects of spectrum use in various frequencies by an increasing number of equipment types.

(17) Protection of public health against electromagnetic fields is essential for citizens' wellbeing and for a coherent approach to spectrum authorisation in the Union; while subject to Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, it is essential to attain a better understanding of the responses of living organisms to electromagnetic fields and to ensure constant monitoring of the ionising and non-ionising effects of spectrum use on health, including the real-life cumulative effects of spectrum use in various frequencies by an increasing number of equipment types.

(18) Essential public interest objectives such as safety of life call for coordinated technical solutions for the interworking of safety and emergency services between Member States. Sufficient spectrum should be made available on a coherent basis for the development and free circulation of safety services and devices and innovative pan-European or interoperable safety and emergency solutions. Studies have already shown the need for additional harmonised spectrum below 1 GHz to deliver mobile broadband services for public protection and disaster relief, across the Union in the next 5 to 10 years.

Satellite will also play an essential role in the delivery of a world class internal and external disaster response capability, a policy goal that has been foreseen in the recent Communication from DG ECHO, which will entail the use of satellite spectrum to contribute to European capabilities both within and beyond Europe’s borders.

Sufficient spectrum should be made available in a coordinated pan-European block of radio spectrum for the development and free circulation of safety services and devices and innovative pan-European or interoperable safety and emergency solutions. Studies have already shown the need for additional harmonised spectrum below 1 GHz to deliver mobile broadband services for public protection and disaster relief, across the Union in the next 5 to 10 years. Any additional harmonised allocation of spectrum for Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) below 1GHz should also include a review of potential to free up or share other PPDR-held spectrum.

(19) Spectrum regulation has strong cross-border or international dimensions, due to propagation characteristics, the international nature of markets dependent on radio-based services, and the need to avoid harmful interference between countries. Moreover, the references to international agreements in Directives 2002/21/EC and 2002/20/EC as amended8 means that Member States shall not enter into international obligations that prevent or constrain the fulfilment of their Union obligations. Member States should, in accordance with the case-law, undertake all necessary efforts to enable appropriate representation of the Union in matters under its competence in international bodies in charge of spectrum coordination. Moreover, where Union policy or competence is at stake, the Union should politically drive the preparation of negotiations and play a role in multilateral negotiations, including in the International Telecommunications Union that corresponds to its level of responsibility for spectrum matters under Union law.

(a) applying technology and service neutrality in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) and where possible the transfer or lease of individual rights to use radio frequencies in accordance with Article 9b of Directive 2002/21/EC in the use of spectrum for electronic communications networks and services in such a way as to promote efficiency of spectrum use, in particular by fostering flexibility, and to promote innovation;

(b) promoting in accordance with Article 9 and 8a of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) and with the Decision 676/2002/EC (Radio Spectrum Decision) the harmonisation of use of radio frequencies across the Community, consistent with the need to ensure effective and efficient use;

c) maintaining and developing effective competition by preventing through ex ante or ex post measures, excessive accumulation of radio frequencies by certain economic operators which results in significant harm to competition.
