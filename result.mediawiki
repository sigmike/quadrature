(9) As underlined in the Digital Agenda for Europe, wireless broadband is an important means to boost <del class="differ">pan-European </del>competition, consumer choice and access in rural and other areas where deployment of wired broadband is difficult or economically unviable. However, spectrum management may affect competition by changing the role and power of market players, for example if existing users receive undue competitive advantages. Limited spectrum access, in particular when appropriate spectrum becomes scarcer, can create a barrier to entry for new services or applications and hamper innovation and competition. Acquisition of new usage rights, including through spectrum trading or other transactions between users, and the introduction of new flexible criteria for spectrum use can have an impact on the existing competitive situation. Member States should therefore take appropriate ex ante or ex post regulatory measures (such as action to amend existing rights, to prohibit certain acquisitions of spectrum rights, to impose conditions on spectrum hoarding and efficient use such as those referred to in Article 9 paragraph 7 of the Framework Directive, to limit the amount of spectrum for each operator, or to avoid excessive accumulation of spectrum) to avoid distortions of competition in line with the principles underpinning Article 5(6) of Directive 2002/20/EC (the "Authorisation" Directive) and Article 1(2) of Directive 87/372/EEC (the "GSM" Directive).<del class="differ"> Member States may also take steps to achieve a more even spectrum allocation between economic operators by reserving spectrum for new entrants to a frequency band or group of bands with similar characteristics.</del>

(9) As underlined in the Digital Agenda for Europe, wireless broadband is an important means to boost competition, consumer choice and access in rural and other areas where deployment of wired broadband is difficult or economically unviable. However, spectrum management may affect competition by changing the role and power of market players, for example if existing users receive undue competitive advantages. <del class="differ">Therefore, the award conditions shall ensure fair competition to ensure broadband communications in regions while new entrants shall not be prevented from the market entry. Also, new technologies should not be discriminated just because they are later available on the market. </del>Limited spectrum access, in particular when appropriate spectrum becomes scarcer, can create a barrier to entry for new services or applications and hamper innovation and competition. Acquisition of new usage rights, including through spectrum trading or other transactions between users, and the introduction of new flexible criteria for spectrum use can have an impact on the existing competitive situation. Member States should therefore take appropriate ex ante or ex post regulatory measures (such as action to amend existing rights, to prohibit certain acquisitions of spectrum rights, to impose conditions on spectrum hoarding and efficient use such as those referred to in Article 9 paragraph 7 of the Framework Directive, to limit the amount of spectrum for each operator, or to avoid excessive accumulation of spectrum) to avoid distortions of competition in line with the principles underpinning Article 5(6) of Directive 2002/20/EC (the ‘Authorisation’ Directive) and Article 1(2) of Directive 87/372/EEC (the ‘GSM’ Directive).

<del class="differ">(12a) According to multiple converging studies, mobile data traffic is increasing rapidly and is currently being doubled every year. With this pace, which is likely to continue in the next coming years, mobile data traffic will have increased nearly 40 times from 2009 to 2014. In order to manage this exponential growth, a number of actions will be required by regulators and market players including increased spectrum efficiency across the board, possible further harmonised spectrum allocations for wireless broadband, and traffic offload onto other networks via multi-mode devices.</del>
